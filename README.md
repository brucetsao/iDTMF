# iDTMF

iDTMF is an App for iPhones used to generate DMTF and ZVEI Tones.
The App has been on the AppStore for a long time, many users have complained about poor signalling quality of the tones, I have not been able to reproduce this. Due to lack of time I would like to offer the Sources to all of you, may be someone can learn from the or even improve and contribute on them.

Please be aware that this sources are pretty old, some things may be outdated. Today (24th of Febuary 2013) they build fine and tones will be generated.
